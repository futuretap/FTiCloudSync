Automatically syncs NSUserDefaults across multiple iOS devices using iCloud key-value storage (`NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore`).

## Installation
Drag all files into your Xcode project.


## Requirements
iCloud requires iOS 5.0 or later. If iCloud is not available, this code does nothing.


## Usage
All write and remove requests to NSUserDefaults are automatically synchronized with iCloud. To prevent synchronization for individual keys, prefix the key with a ! (exclamation mark).

To respond to updates from iCloud you can observe the `FTiCloudSyncDidUpdateNotification`. It contains the `NSUserDefaults` object and in the `userInfo` a dictionary with `FTiCloudSyncChangedKeys` and `FTiCloudSyncRemovedKeys`. These are arrays of the changed and removed keys.


## Compatibility
FTiCloudSync is compatible with [InAppSettingsKit](http://www.inappsettingskit.com), a framework to easily add in-app settings to iPhone apps. InAppSettingsKit automatically updates the UI when an iCloud update is received.
